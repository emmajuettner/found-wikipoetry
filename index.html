<h1>Found Wikipoetry</h1>
<p>A fun way to make collage poems/found poems is to use fragments from random Wikipedia pages. You can follow the process below to create such poems:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Wikipedia's random page link</a>.</li>
	<li>Choose an interesting word or phrase from the text on that page, and write it down.</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you have an interesting poem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Or, for a more focused variation:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choose a category from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Categories">Wikipedia's list of categories</a>. If you're indecisive, you can get a <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random/Category">random Wikipedia category</a>.</li>
	<li>Go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RandomInCategory">Wikipedia's random page in category link</a>, enter the category you've chosen, and press 'Go'.</li>
	<li>Choose an interesting word or phrase from the text on that page, and write it down.</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have an interesting poem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not every iteration of this process will produce an interesting or even coherent poem. That's what makes it challenging, and fun! (Before doing this project, I did not realize how many one- or two-line Wikipedia pages there are about various species of moth.) The poems I've compiled here are the best outputs I got from doing this exercise a bunch of times.</p>

<h2>My Wikipoems</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="duplication.html">Duplication</a></li>
	<li><a href="ersatz-downtowns.html">Ersatz Downtowns</a></li>

</ul>

<p>If you like this concept, you might also like the <a href="https://botsin.space/@wikipediahaiku">Wikipedia Haiku Bot</a>.
It's a fediverse account that posts sentences from random Wikipedia pages which happen to form haikus.
I didn't create this bot, I just think it's neat.</p>
